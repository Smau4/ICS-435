# ICS-435
Supervised and unsupervised machine learning projects written in Python using the sklearn library

- Will generate linearly separable training data sets.
- Creates either Gaussian/Poisson noise with amplitude A, adds to linearly separable set
- Tests parameters for nu, noise amplitude, type of noise.  Generates plots.
- Measures the epsilon value.
- Generates another set from the same parameters, tests how well the data fits.
